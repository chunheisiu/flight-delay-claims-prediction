## Flight Delay Claims Prediction

### Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict the claim amount for flight delays, using a learning dataset with flight delay claims from Jan 2013 to Jul 2016.
Per the instructions, a higher amount of predicted claim, with the cap of $800, is assigned to high-risk flights to adequately compensate the risk and naturally screen out the high risk flights.
A lower amount of predicted claim, as low as 0, should be assigned to low-risk flights to increase the conversion for a low-risk customer to buy and expand the risk pool.
The optimization of the predictions should result in a very low aggregated absolute error between the expected and actual claims, meaning that the customers are not over or under-charged.

This project is the data scientist take-home technical assessment for GoodNotes and T1.
